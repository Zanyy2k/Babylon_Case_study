# OHM Model
Overview
The OHM model is an agent-based simulation designed to model a staking token economy. It simulates the behavior of stakers, validators, and the economic dynamics of the token supply over time.

## Model Components
Staker
Attributes:

holding: Amount of tokens held by the staker.
Methods:

setup(): Initialize staker attributes.
stake(amount): Stake a certain amount of tokens.
unstake(amount): Unstake a certain amount of tokens.
Validator
Attributes:

operational_cost: Operational cost incurred by the validator.
performance: Placeholder for validator performance.
Methods:

setup(): Initialize validator attributes.
validate(): Placeholder validation logic.
OHM Model
Parameters:

initial_supply: Initial supply of tokens.
yearly_emissions: Yearly emissions rate for the first decade.
validator_incentives: Validator incentives rate.
... (other parameters)
Model Components:

stakers: AgentList of Staker agents.
validators_L1: AgentList of Validator agents for Layer 1.
validators_middleware: AgentList of Validator agents for middleware.
treasury: Treasury to store rewards.
total_supply: Total token supply.
Methods:

setup(): Initialize model parameters and components.
step(): Perform model steps, including staker and validator behaviors.
calculate_total_supply(): Calculate the total token supply.
Usage
Install Dependencies:
